# customer-segmentation
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behavior using a structured data analysis pipeline. It employs three key methodologies:
1- Backward Elimination to refine feature selection.
2- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
3- Clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
The ultimate goal is to uncover meaningful insights from customer data to better understand purchasing habits and preferences, which can help inform business strategies.

Technologies and Libraries
Python: Data cleaning, backward elimination, PCA, and clustering (libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn).
Visualization: Pair plots, PCA biplots, and clustering visualizations were used for detailed data analysis.
